Welcome to my web portfolio!
I'm a passionate and creative Computer Science student with a keen eye for design and a love for clean, user-friendly websites. This portfolio showcases a collection of my front-end and full-stack web development projects, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other modern tools and frameworks.

From responsive landing pages to interactive web apps, each project reflects my journey of learning, problem-solving, and bringing ideas to life on the web. Whether you're a recruiter, collaborator, or just browsingâ€”feel free to explore and connect!
